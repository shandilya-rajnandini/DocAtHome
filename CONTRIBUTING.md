## üåü Staging Environment Workflow

We use a **staging-first deployment strategy** to ensure quality and prevent bugs from reaching production:

### Branch Structure
- **`main`** - Production branch (only project admins can merge)
- **`develop`** - Staging branch for testing new features

### Deployment URLs
- **Production**: https://docathome.netlify.app
- **Staging**: https://develop--docathome.netlify.app (auto-deployed from `develop` branch)
- **Backend Production**: https://docathome-backend.onrender.com
- **Backend Staging**: https://docathome-backend-staging.onrender.com

### Contribution Flow
1. **Create feature branch** from `develop`
2. **Make changes** and test locally
3. **Push to your fork** and create PR to `develop`
4. **Test on staging** - Your changes will be automatically deployed to staging
5. **Project admin reviews** and merges to `develop`
6. **Final testing** on staging environment
7. **Release to production** - Admin merges `develop` into `main`

### Testing Requirements
- ‚úÖ All tests pass locally
- ‚úÖ Feature works on staging environment
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes
- ‚úÖ Code review approved

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear and meaningful commit messages. Follow this format:

```
type(scope): short description
```

**Examples:**

- `feat(auth): add two-factor authentication`
- `fix(profile): resolve avatar upload issue`
- `docs(contributing): update staging workflow`
- `refactor(api): optimize database queries`

**Common types:**

- `feat` = new feature
- `fix` = bug fix
- `docs` = documentation only changes
- `style` = formatting only
- `refactor` = code restructure (no logic change)
- `test` = adding or updating tests
- `chore` = maintenance tasks
