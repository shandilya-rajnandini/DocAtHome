            My neighbor's mother slipped in the bathroom and hurt her back badly
            and was barely able to move. It was risky transferring her on our
            personal vehicle as we would have added to her pain. I called for an
            ambulance it was taking time so I called Ziqitza and ambulance came
            within no time and safely transfer her to the hospital were proper
            first aid was given to her till we reach hospital.
